Description: Foreign Function Interface for Python 3 calling C code
 Convenient and reliable way of calling C code from Python 3.
 .
 The aim of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable way of calling
 C code from Python. It keeps Python logic in Python, and minimises the C
 required. It is able to work at either the C API or ABI level, unlike most
 other approaches, that only support the ABI level.
 .
 This package contains the necessary build and runtime support for cffi
 modules.
